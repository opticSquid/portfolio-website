      Introduction From a user's perspective Lez.urly is a platfrom where users
      come to see which places like hotels, malls, restaurants, parks, concerts
      etc they should visit to have the best experience. Suppose you are
      thinking of going somewhere on weekends, you come to this website see
      different places nearby, see what they have to offer, you can see photos
      and videos of that place, reviews by other users and ratings and other
      related details (like menu and operational timing for a hotel). Then if
      you like the place you can directly book the place or get a ticket to that
      place. From a Business's perspective For a business you get to directly
      promote your product in front of a large audience and engage with them to
      clear their queries and provide information. You directly get to know from
      our metrics that how your product is performing compared to other similar
      businesses arround you. You get to know your customers and thier interests
      better so that helps you to tailor the experience according to your
      customer/audience which in a long term benefits your business because they
      will stick longer. Customers can also do transactions very easily and
      hassle free from our app only which they are familiar with so, it also
      builds trust with them and also may contribute to your business recieveing
      more traffic. More you maintain your rating and have people say good
      things about you have more relevance and your search ranking increases and
      you get more traffic. From our's perspective In our platform we have two
      types of users Normal Users or Visitors Businesses or Partner Businesses
      (PBs) We have the data of the visitors and their usage patterns on their
      age, country, region, approximate location information so we know what
      type of places they like and how much they can afford to spend. So, we
      will recommend them places tailored to that. If our suggestions get better
      they would visit more regularly and transact with PBs more. For the PBs we
      can show them what type of customers are coming to them, what type of
      places interest them, their average spending, the click through rate of
      their business, their engagement rate, their reviews and ratings and how
      their metrics compare to other competetor businesses in their area (We
      will anonimize the other competetor businesses data and show them an
      average). For the visitors To the visitors we offer them better
      recommendations based on their data. For the PBs To the PBs we offer them
      larger customer base and a direct way to engage with their customers and
      an easy and familiar way to book their services, and data to make their
      products better. We Keep There can be multiple ways to monetize our
      business We can keep a cut every time a visitor transacts through our
      platform and books a service of a PB. We can make a subscription system
      for the PBs to remain in our platform on a regular interval basis and get
      access to our visitors and our metrics. If I come up with a better plan
      for monetization I will list it here
